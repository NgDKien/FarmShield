# FarmShield YOLOv8 Integration - Summary

## Overview
We've successfully integrated YOLOv8 human tracking into the FarmShield system to detect hand washing and cloth changes after face recognition.

## Components Created

### 1. YOLO Tracking Service (`yolo_tracking_service.py`)
- Implements human detection and tracking using YOLOv8
- Detects cloth changes using color histogram comparison
- Detects hand washing based on movement patterns and location
- Runs in a separate thread for real-time processing

### 2. WebSocket Integration (`face_detection_RTSP_v4.py`)
- Added `start_tracking` and `stop_tracking` WebSocket commands
- Integrated with existing camera management system
- Properly handles service shutdown

### 3. Test Script (`test_yolo_tracking.py`)
- Standalone test script for verifying YOLO tracking functionality
- Works with both webcam and RTSP streams

### 4. Documentation (`Y0LO_TRACKING_README.md`)
- Comprehensive documentation for the new service
- Usage instructions and integration guide

## Key Features

1. **Real-time Human Tracking**: Uses YOLOv8 to detect and track people in video streams
2. **Cloth Change Detection**: Compares color histograms to detect clothing changes
3. **Hand Washing Detection**: Monitors movement patterns in sink areas
4. **WebSocket Control**: Start/stop tracking via existing WebSocket interface
5. **Thread-safe Operation**: Properly handles concurrent access

## How It Works

1. After a person is registered via face recognition, the system can start YOLO tracking
2. The tracking service monitors the video feed for the registered person
3. When cloth changes or hand washing actions are detected, callbacks are triggered
4. These events can be integrated with backend systems for notifications or logging

## Usage

1. Send a WebSocket command to start tracking:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "start_tracking",
     "camera_id": "cam_001",
     "rtsp_url": "rtsp://example.com/stream"
   }
   ```

2. The system will automatically detect:
   - When a person changes clothes (based on color histogram comparison)
   - When a person washes their hands (based on movement in sink areas)

3. Events are logged to the console and can be integrated with backend APIs
